I then implemented a nodes list full of temperatures and decided to initialize an ArrayList of ArrayLists as my edges. |
| January 15 | 8:45pm-11:05pm | After initializing the edges, I made a nested for loop where I find all greater temperatures than a given node and it to list at a given index corresponding to the chronological order of the temperatures. For a short bit, I thought for some reason that you could solve the problem by finding the smallest jump in temp within reason in terms of distance between temperatures but I quickly shut down that idea. I considered various ways I could find the "longest path" after making that graph and decided using dfs from each node to figure out the longest path to one of the higher temperatures at the end could be viable. But, I realized I wasn't exactly finding a path between two given temperatures because the highest temperature isn't necessarily involved in the longest path unless its the last one. Also, I realized that the size of the arrays I was making for edges could also be really large. I was pretty confident I was still on the right track but I looked back at my problem set and decided to shift my approach to the problem once again. I realized that the total number of potential actual temperatures was much less than the number of temperatures in the list. So, I considered if there was some sort of way to keep track of temperatures based on their value rather than their position and use that to my advantage. Since the problem states that all temperatures are between -50 and 130, I thought I could try making an array of that length and storing the longest warming run at a given index that represents a temperature. I made my array the size of the range of temperatures and figured I could run through the temperatures once and determine the longest warming run within that one loop by using some sort of previous Max vs current Max situation. First, I shifted every temperature by 50 to ensure it could become an index in my array. I got stuck after this for a while but tried calculating the longest possible warming trend for a given temperature by keeping track of all the max runs involving temperatures below. With that, I could simply add one to the longest previous warming trend and index store it at the current temp's corresponding index. I considered if I needed to make another for loop to go through the loop containing max runs but realizing if I had a variable that dynamically changed throughout if the new longest run was greater than the previous. Then, I could return the variable. I got functioning code after fixing some small index out of bounds errors and my code now passes 2 tests. |
